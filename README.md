## About The Project


In this program, we want to do lexical analysis and receive the input title of the Java code as a txt file, and our output file includes that we identify the variables and specify their type and value (of course, as a preliminary).
If a variable was defined in several places, we consider only the original type and record it the first time.
If a variable was set in several places, we consider the last value given to it.





### Built With
